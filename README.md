Sourcery templates to generate Unit-Tests 

These templates where created for a Bachelor Thesis. They create Unit-Tests for models in a Swift projekt. The goal of the paper was it to test if generating complex code using code generator is possible and which of the supported languages should be used.
All three Templates have the same goal of creating these Unit-Tests. They have small differences in their capabilities do to limitations of the programming language.
